# Dave's Reaper Stuff

This is the place where I will upload various additions I make for Reaper for my own personal use that I wish to share with the community.

You're free to download and use these files in any way you wish. If you find any bugs please let me know. 

Where I have incorporated GPL code of other developers I have provided appropriate credit in the source code comments. If you see some of your code that I've used and haven't credit please let me know so I can correct that.

I'm active on the Reaper forum under the name Reddiesel41264 - http://forum.cockos.com/member.php?u=41390

# Installation
Scripts, plugins and icons should be placed in the appropriate sub-folder in your Reaper resource folder. You can find out where the resource folder is by going to the Options menu in Reaper and selecting Show REAPER resource path in explorer/finder...

Lua scripts should be placed in the Scripts folder.

JSFX Plugins should be placed in the Effects folder.

Toolbar icons should be placed in the Data\toolbar_icons folder.

For the Lua scripts it is important that the folder structure I have used in the repository is maintained when you install them on your system. This is because many of the scripts rely on one or more library scripts and require a specific relative path in order to find these library scripts.

# Tutorials
Video tutorials will be made available occassionally. You'll be able to find them at my YouTube channels https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZmvbtnwZmmI7lHFa4BQiRA - Old videos
